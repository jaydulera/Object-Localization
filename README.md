### Object-Localization

A Object Localiztion pipeline based using YOLOv5 as the base model.

### Algorithm Used:

- YOLOv5

YOLO is an acronym for “You Only Look Once”, it is considered the first choice for real-time object detection among many computer vision and machine learning experts and this is simply because of it’s the state-of-the-art real-time object detection algorithm in terms of performance(FPS), ease of use(setting up and configurations) and versatility(models can be coverted to serve different devices).
